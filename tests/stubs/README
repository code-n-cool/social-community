This directory contains stubs of Talon APIs. It is included via run_tests.py so we can run our test cases outside the Talon environment.

The implementation of the stubs will mostly be noops, but some functionality (e.g. actions) are needed by tests and so are implemented to allow for easy introspection and changing.
